üí° How the AI Integration Works
The "Generate with AI" buttons trigger a call to the Google Gemini API. The prompt sent to the AI includes relevant context from other filled fields in your resume (e.g., your name, programming languages, project titles) to help the AI generate more personalized and relevant text for that specific section. This helps overcome writer's block and provides a strong foundation for you to refine.
